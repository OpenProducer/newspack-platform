> Newspack Platform – Architecture and Development Flow
> Modeled on Newspack Radio Pro's architecture doc. Status: in progress.

## Progress log

- **2026-07-24**: `sync-plugins.sh` written, tested, and debugged against real Terminus/Pantheon on all three environments (`dev`, `radio`, `podcast`). All three are currently synced and clean (`connection_mode: git`). Two real bugs found and fixed along the way (see "Known issues fixed" below) — read that section before touching `sync-plugins.sh` again, it explains why the retry/backoff logic exists.
- **2026-07-24**: `master`'s `dev` environment has NOT yet been promoted to `test`/`live` (see Promotion pipeline section).
- **2026-07-24**: Theme divergence investigated and resolved (see "Custom theme repos" below) — `radio` confirmed as the canonical source for `newspack-radio-theme`. Subtree-split extraction commands validated in a scratch clone (both extractions succeed cleanly, real history intact).
- **2026-07-24**: `OpenProducer/newspack-theme-child` and `OpenProducer/newspack-radio-theme` created on GitHub (empty, no auto-init) and the validated extraction run for real from this repo on the `radio` branch. `newspack-radio-theme` pushed as 6 commits (`4559684`), `newspack-theme-child` pushed as 10 commits (`ab6627e`) — both match the scratch-clone dry run exactly (same file sets, same commit counts). Both repos are currently **private** and their default branch is `main` (not the extraction branch names — those were pushed as `extract-*:main` then deleted locally). Next: clone both locally as siblings of this repo and wire the Studio symlinks (Step 3 onward below).
- **2026-07-24**: Both new repos flipped to **public** (`gh repo edit --visibility public`), matching `newspack-platform`'s own visibility. Both cloned locally as siblings of this repo (`~/Dev/projects/newspack-theme-child`, `~/Dev/projects/newspack-radio-theme`) and re-verified post-clone: 10 commits / 4 files (`functions.php`, `style.css`, `screenshot.png`, `style.ctcbackup.css`) for theme-child, 6 commits / 3 files (no `style.ctcbackup.css`) for radio-theme — no `wp-content/` contamination in either.
- **2026-07-24**: Two blockers found while continuing the rollout — **open question #3 (Studio path) is not actually resolved yet, and `sync-themes.sh` cannot currently run on this machine.** Neither is fixed; both need a decision before proceeding. Details:
  - No Studio site is registered for `newspack-platform` at all. `~/.studio/cli.json` lists exactly three sites — `angelcityjazz`, `Newspack Radio Pro` (path `~/Dev/local/wordpress/studio/newspack-radio-pro`), and `test-site` — and none of the three is a git checkout of this repo (`git remote -v` inside each errors with "not a git repository"). "Newspack Radio Pro" is the separate reference site this doc's `functions.php` divergence check cross-referenced (see "Custom theme repos" above), not a Studio instance of `newspack-platform`. The "Local rapid development" section's Step 1 (clone this repo, check out a branch, open it as a Studio site) has never actually been done.
  - `sync-themes.sh` fails immediately on `--dry-run`: `./sync-themes.sh: line 37: master: unbound variable`. Root cause: it uses bash associative arrays (`declare -A`, lines 37 and 97), which require bash ≥4, but the script's `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang resolves to macOS's stock `/bin/bash` (3.2.57) on this machine — there's no Homebrew `bash` installed to shadow it. `sync-plugins.sh` doesn't use associative arrays and is unaffected. This is presumably why the doc already flagged `sync-themes.sh` as "still completely untested" — it's never actually been run here.
- **`sync-themes.sh` is still completely untested** — it has no real theme repos to sync from yet.

## Known issues fixed in sync-plugins.sh (read before modifying)

1. Used `terminus connection:info --field=connection_mode`, which doesn't expose that field at all (only SFTP/Git/MySQL connection strings). Fixed to use `terminus env:info --field=connection_mode` instead (matches the "Connection Mode" column in `terminus env:list`).
2. `terminus env:commit` and the subsequent `terminus connection:set ... git` can both report false negatives ("no code to commit" / "uncommitted changes") for several seconds after a real change lands, due to Pantheon-side propagation lag — this actually caused a full silent failure on `podcast` once (update applied, never committed, script claimed success anyway). Fixed with explicit retry/backoff loops around both the commit and the mode-switch steps, checking Terminus's actual output text rather than just exit codes, and refusing to proceed past an ambiguous state. The mode-switch call also runs with stdin closed so an unexpected "are you sure, this discards your work" prompt fails safe (defaults to no) instead of hanging or getting blindly confirmed.

## Guiding principle

- **Site repo (`newspack-platform`) = deployment vehicle.** Three branches, one Pantheon site (`newspack`), three multidev environments. Never hand-edited for plugin/theme code.
- **Custom theme layer = controlled iteration layer.** `newspack-theme-child` and `newspack-radio-theme` are the only code we author. They live in their own repos and are synced in, never edited inside the site repo.
- **Everything else = automated.** Newspack's own plugins, `newspack-theme`, `newspack-block-theme`, the radio/podcast add-ons, and every WordPress.org-hosted plugin Newspack recommends (Jetpack, Yoast SEO, Site Kit, Co-Authors Plus, etc.) are pulled and updated by script — no dashboard SFTP, no manual downloads.

## Branches and environments

Confirmed via `terminus site:info newspack` and `terminus env:list newspack` (2026-07-24). Full environment list on the site: `dev`, `test`, `live`, `radio`, `podcast`, `donate`.

| Branch | Pantheon env(s) | URL | Plugins/themes beyond core Newspack |
|---|---|---|---|
| `master` | `dev` → `test` → `live` (promotion pipeline) | dev/test/live-newspack.pantheonsite.io | `newspack-theme-child` |
| `radio` | `radio` (flat, no test/live tier) | radio-newspack.pantheonsite.io | `radio-station`, `mp3-music-player-by-sonaar`, `newspack-theme-child`, `newspack-radio-theme` |
| `podcast` | `podcast` (flat, no test/live tier) | podcast-newspack.pantheonsite.io | `simple-podcasting`, `newspack-theme-child`, `newspack-radio-theme` |
| — | `donate` | donate-newspack.pantheonsite.io | Out of scope for this automation for now |

Remotes on the site repo: `origin` → Pantheon (drush.in), `github` → `OpenProducer/newspack-platform`. Each environment is updated independently — never merge plugin/theme updates between branches.

### Promotion pipeline (master branch only)

`master` is the only branch with a `dev`/`test`/`live` tier. `sync-plugins.sh` and `sync-themes.sh` only ever act on `dev` — they hard-refuse `test`/`live` as targets. Getting a validated change to production is a separate, manual promotion step:

```
terminus env:deploy newspack.test --message="Promote plugin/theme updates"
# verify test
terminus env:deploy newspack.live --message="Promote plugin/theme updates"
```

`radio` and `podcast` have no test/live tier — their multidev *is* the live site for that variant, so a sync there is immediately public. Treat those runs with the same caution you'd give a production deploy.

## Custom theme repos (new)

| Theme | Used on | Repo (proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| `newspack-theme-child` | master, radio, podcast | `OpenProducer/newspack-theme-child` |
| `newspack-radio-theme` | radio, podcast, Radio Pro site | `OpenProducer/newspack-radio-theme` |

Today both live as plain, historyless directories baked into all three branches. The change: give each its own repo with real history, and stop editing them inside `newspack-platform`. Local edits happen in the theme repos themselves; `sync-themes.sh` pushes the current state into whichever branches use them.

**Extraction source, confirmed 2026-07-24:**
- `newspack-theme-child` is byte-identical across `master`/`radio`/`podcast` — no conflict, extract from any (used `radio`).
- `newspack-radio-theme` had **diverged** between `radio` and `podcast` — `radio`'s `functions.php` carries active 2025-12-05 development (carousel/venue/date injection logic); `podcast`'s copy hasn't been touched since 2024-12-11 and lacks that logic entirely, carrying different TEC boilerplate instead. Confirmed via git log dates and cross-checked byte-for-byte against the live Radio Pro Studio install (`newspack-radio-pro/wp-content/themes/newspack-radio-theme`), which matches `radio` exactly. **`radio` is the canonical source.** Extracting it means `podcast` will pick up the carousel logic it's currently missing the first time `sync-themes.sh --branch podcast` runs — expected, not a regression, but worth a visual check on the podcast site afterward since it's new behavior there.

## Local rapid development — WordPress Studio

Single Studio site, branch-switched (not one Studio site per branch):

1. Clone `newspack-platform`, check out the branch you're working on (`master`, `radio`, or `podcast`) as a Studio site.
2. Clone `newspack-theme-child` and `newspack-radio-theme` locally, outside the Studio site directory.
3. Symlink them into the Studio site's `wp-content/themes/`:
   ```
   ln -s ~/Dev/projects/newspack-theme-child   wp-content/themes/newspack-theme-child
   ln -s ~/Dev/projects/newspack-radio-theme   wp-content/themes/newspack-radio-theme
   ```
4. Edits in the theme repos reflect instantly in Studio — no copy step, same benefit the symlink approach gave Radio Pro's enhancements plugin.

Switching branches: check out the new branch in `newspack-platform`, confirm the symlinks still resolve (they will, since the theme repos live outside the site repo), restart Studio's site if needed.

*Note: confirm the exact local folder Studio uses for a given site (via its "Open in Terminal" / site settings) before wiring the symlinks — this can vary by Studio version and wasn't verified against your installed version.*

## Two-script automation architecture

Both scripts live at the site repo root, same guarded pattern as Radio Pro's three scripts. Safe test entry point for either:

```
./sync-[script].sh --dry-run
```

### `sync-plugins.sh` — WordPress.org plugins & themes via Terminus

```
./sync-plugins.sh --env dev      # master branch
./sync-plugins.sh --env radio    # radio branch
./sync-plugins.sh --env podcast  # podcast branch
./sync-plugins.sh --env dev --dry-run
```

What it automates:
- Authenticates with Terminus
- Queries available plugin **and** theme updates via WP-CLI (`--format=json`)
- Skips and flags pre-release versions (alpha/beta/rc) automatically
- Always excludes the guarded custom themes (`newspack-theme-child`, `newspack-radio-theme`)
- Switches the target environment to SFTP mode
- Runs `wp plugin update --all` and `wp theme update` (guarded themes excluded)
- Shows a diff/summary before committing
- Commits via `terminus env:commit` with an auto-generated message listing updated slugs + versions
- Switches the environment back to Git mode, verifies the switch
- Prints a structured summary report

This replaces the manual Pantheon Dashboard → SFTP → wp-admin update workflow entirely.

### `sync-themes.sh` — custom child themes

```
./sync-themes.sh --branch master    # newspack-theme-child only
./sync-themes.sh --branch radio     # both themes
./sync-themes.sh --branch podcast   # both themes
./sync-themes.sh --branch radio --dry-run
```

What it automates:
- Verifies the site repo is on the target branch and clean
- Verifies each source theme repo is clean and on its production branch
- Rsyncs the relevant theme(s) into `wp-content/themes/` in the site repo
- Shows `git diff --stat` before committing
- Auto-generates commit message: `Sync themes: newspack-theme-child@<hash> [newspack-radio-theme@<hash>]`
- Pushes to both `origin` (Pantheon) and `github`

This replaces the manual "download from GitHub, copy-paste locally" theme workflow.

## Guardrails

- Never edit plugin or theme code directly inside `wp-content/` in the site repo — all changes originate in `sync-plugins.sh` (upstream pulls) or the theme repos (via `sync-themes.sh`).
- `sync-plugins.sh` always excludes the two guarded custom themes.
- Pre-release plugin/theme versions are never auto-updated.
- Each branch/environment is updated independently; never merge plugin or theme updates between `master`, `radio`, and `podcast`.
- Run `sync-plugins.sh` before `sync-themes.sh` in the same session to avoid push conflicts, mirroring Radio Pro's script-ordering rule.
- Tag only after post-sync verification passes (site loads, no PHP warnings, affected features spot-checked).
- `sync-plugins.sh` and `sync-themes.sh` never target `test`, `live`, or `donate` — `test`/`live` are reached only via `terminus env:deploy` promotion from a verified `dev`; `donate` is out of scope for now.

## Open questions before this ships

1. **Theme sourcing mechanism** — pull `newspack-theme`/`newspack-block-theme` updates directly from their individual Automattic repos, or lean on `newspack-workspace`'s `clone-repos.sh`/`n pull` as the fetch mechanism feeding `sync-plugins.sh`?
2. **GitHub sync for `sync-plugins.sh`** — Radio Pro's plugin-update script only commits on Pantheon's internal git per environment; it doesn't push those commits to GitHub. Decide whether `sync-plugins.sh` should also pull-and-push to `github` after `terminus env:commit`, or whether GitHub stays theme-repo-only and gets periodic manual syncs from Pantheon.
3. **Studio local site path** — confirm the actual filesystem path Studio uses so the symlink step in the setup checklist is accurate.

~~4. History for the two extracted themes~~ — resolved 2026-07-24: preserve history via `git subtree split`, not a fresh start. See "Theme repo extraction" below for the validated commands.

~~5. Environment topology~~ — resolved 2026-07-24: `dev`/`test`/`live` promotion pipeline for `master`; `radio`/`podcast` are flat (no test/live); `donate` confirmed out of scope.

## Theme repo extraction (validated and executed 2026-07-24)

Commands below were dry-run in a disposable scratch clone (`git clone` to `/tmp`, never touched the real repo) and both extractions succeeded cleanly:
- `newspack-radio-theme` → 6 commits of real history (`functions.php`, `style.css`, `screenshot.png` only, no `wp-content/` path contamination). Carries the full carousel/venue feature evolution.
- `newspack-theme-child` → 10 commits (adds `style.ctcbackup.css`).

Both extracted from the `radio` branch (confirmed canonical source, see above) — not `master` or `podcast`.

**Step 1 — create two empty repos on GitHub**, no README/license/gitignore (an initial auto-commit would conflict with the extracted history): `OpenProducer/newspack-theme-child` and `OpenProducer/newspack-radio-theme`.

**Step 2 — from inside `newspack-platform`** (this repo, NOT the new theme repos):
```
git checkout radio

git subtree split --prefix=wp-content/themes/newspack-radio-theme -b extract-radio-theme
git subtree split --prefix=wp-content/themes/newspack-theme-child -b extract-theme-child

git push git@github.com:OpenProducer/newspack-radio-theme.git extract-radio-theme:main
git push git@github.com:OpenProducer/newspack-theme-child.git extract-theme-child:main

# clean up the local extraction branches once pushed
git branch -D extract-radio-theme extract-theme-child
git checkout master
```

**Step 3 — clone both new repos locally**, siblings of `newspack-platform` (matches the default `THEME_CHILD_REPO`/`RADIO_THEME_REPO` paths `sync-themes.sh` already expects, so no script edits needed):
```
git clone git@github.com:OpenProducer/newspack-theme-child.git ~/Dev/projects/newspack-theme-child
git clone git@github.com:OpenProducer/newspack-radio-theme.git ~/Dev/projects/newspack-radio-theme
```

**Step 4 — first real test**: `./sync-themes.sh --branch master --dry-run` (theme-child only, lowest risk), then a real run, then `radio`/`podcast`. Expect `podcast` to pick up the carousel/venue logic it's currently missing — that's expected new behavior, not a bug, so do a visual check on the podcast site's carousel after that specific run.

**Step 5 — Studio symlinks** (once repos are cloned locally):
```
ln -s ~/Dev/projects/newspack-theme-child   wp-content/themes/newspack-theme-child
ln -s ~/Dev/projects/newspack-radio-theme   wp-content/themes/newspack-radio-theme
```

## Rollout checklist

1. ~~Confirm Terminus auth and the Pantheon site/environment machine names~~ — done: site `newspack`; envs `dev`, `test`, `live`, `radio`, `podcast`, `donate`.
2. ~~Validate `sync-plugins.sh`~~ — done on all three environments (`dev`, `radio`, `podcast`); see Progress log and Known issues above.
3. ~~Create `OpenProducer/newspack-theme-child` and `OpenProducer/newspack-radio-theme` on GitHub and run the extraction~~ — done 2026-07-24, see Progress log and "Theme repo extraction" above.
4. **Current task**: clone both new theme repos locally; wire the WordPress Studio symlinks.
5. `sync-themes.sh --branch master --dry-run`, then a real run on `master` (theme-child only, lowest risk).
6. `sync-themes.sh --branch radio --dry-run`, then a real run; then same for `podcast` — expect podcast's carousel behavior to change, that's intentional (see above).
7. Promote `master`'s plugin + theme changes: `terminus env:deploy newspack.test`, verify, `terminus env:deploy newspack.live`.
8. Once plugins and themes are validated end to end on all three branches, retire the manual Pantheon Dashboard SFTP workflow and the manual theme download/copy-paste workflow.
