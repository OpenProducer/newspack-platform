== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do the XML Sitemaps in the Yoast SEO plugin work? =

Having an XML sitemap can be beneficial for SEO, as Google can retrieve essential pages of a website very fast, even if the internal linking of a site isn’t flawless.
The sitemap index and individual sitemaps are updated automatically as you add or remove content and will include the post types you want search engines to index. Post Types marked as noindex will not appear in the sitemap. [Learn more about XML Sitemaps](https://yoa.st/3qt).

= How can I add my website to Google Search Console? =

It is straightforward to add your website to Google Search Console. 
1. Create a Google Search Console account and login into your account.
1. Click ‘Add a property’ under the search drop-down.
1. Enter your website URL in the box and click ‘Continue’.

= How do I implement Yoast SEO breadcrumbs? =

The steps below are a temporary solution as manual edits made to theme files may be overwritten with future theme updates. Please contact the theme developer for a permanent solution. We’ve written an article about the [importance of breadcrumbs for SEO](https://yoa.st/3qv). 

To implement the [breadcrumbs]https://yoa.st/3qw) function in Yoast SEO, you will have to edit your theme. We recommend that prior to any editing of the theme files, a backup is taken. Your host provider can help you take a backup.
Copy the following code into your theme where you want the breadcrumbs to be. If you are not sure, you will need to experiment with placement:

```
<?php
*if* ( function_exists(‘yoast_breadcrumb’) ) {
  yoast_breadcrumb( ‘<p id=“breadcrumbs”>’,’</p>’ );
}
?>
```

Common places where you could place your breadcrumbs are inside your `single.php` and/or `page.php` file just above the page’s title. Another option that makes it really easy in some themes is by just pasting the code in `header.php`at the very end.

In most non-WooTheme themes, this code snippet should not be added to your `functions.php` file. 
Alternatively, you can manually add the breadcrumb shortcode to individual posts or pages: `[wpseo_breadcrumb]`

If you need more details or a step by step guide, read our [Implementation guide for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qx).

= How do I noindex URLS? =

Yoast SEO provides multiple options for setting a URL or group of URLs to noindex. [Read more about how to do this in this guide](https://yoa.st/3qy/).

= Google shows the wrong description, how do I fix this? =

If you’ve crafted nice meta descriptions for your blog posts, nothing is more annoying than Google showing another description for your site completely in the search result snippet. 

Possible causes could be:
1. wrong description in code
2. Google cache is outdated
3. Search term manipulation
4. Google ignored the meta description

You can [read more here on how to solve the issue with the wrong description](https://yoa.st/3qz).

= How often is Yoast SEO updated? =

Yoast SEO is updated every two weeks. If you want to know why, please read [this post on why we release every two weeks](https://yoa.st/3q-)!

= How do I get support? =

As our free plugin is used by millions of people worldwide, we cannot offer you all one on one support. If you have trouble with the Yoast SEO for WordPress plugin, you can get help on the support forums here at [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/) or by checking out or knowledge base at [kb.yoast.com](https://yoa.st/3r1). 

The plugins you buy at Yoast are called ‘premium plugins’ (even if Premium isn’t in its name) and include a complete year of free updates and premium support. This means you can contact our support team if you have any questions about that plugin.

== Changelog ==

= 14.0.4 =
Release Date: April 30th, 2020

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where robots meta values defaulted to 0 instead of null because of a [bug in WPDB](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12819). This could result in incorrect values for `noindex`, `nofollow` , `noarchive`, `noimageindex` and/or `nosnippet`. In order to purge the wrong data, we need to truncate our tables again. This means you will have to go through the indexing process again. We’re very sorry. For sites with more than 10,000 posts, we advise using the [WP CLI command to do the indexation on the server](https://yoa.st/wp-cli-index).

= 14.0.3 =
Release Date: April 30th, 2020

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where running the migrations could cause fatal errors on sites where plugins are installed remotely. Some remote plugin installers don't remove files that are removed in an update. Since our migration runner goes through all migrations on the server, this could lead to fatal errors.
* Fixes a bug where the `pre_get_document_title filter` could be skipped when other plugins were using this filter as well.
* Fixes a bug where an error would be thrown when the name of an indexable table had been converted to a different case.
* Fixes a bug where a taxonomy parent would not be present in the breadcrumbs even though it was set in the breadcrumbs settings.

Enhancements:

* Adds a missing index to the new indexables table. Props to [@pagelypete](https://github.com/pagelypete).

Other:

* Adds the wpseo_frontend_presentation filter that can be used by third-party plugins to easily alter all our meta output with 1 single filter.

= 14.0.2 =
Release Date: April 29th, 2020

Because we’ve changed the underlying framework of our Indexables technology, we’ve chosen to rebuild the table. This means you will have to go through the indexing process again. We’re sorry. For sites with more than 10,000 posts, we advise using the [WP CLI command to do the indexation on the server](https://yoa.st/wp-cli-index).

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when a title contained more than 191 characters.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when a focus keyphrase contained more than 191 characters.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when search engines were disallowed from indexing the site.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown on WooCommerce installations when the `wpseo_metadesc` filter was called with only 1 argument.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when using the `WPSEO_Frontend` class to get the meta description.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when `WPSEO_Frontend` or `WPSEO_Breadcrumbs` was called before the `init` action.
* Fixes a bug where a non-object property retrieval notice would be thrown when the site's content was being indexed.
* Fixes a bug where a trailing slash would be added to canonical URLs and some `rel="prev"` URLs, even when the permalink structure settings didn't contain that trailing slash.
* Fixes a bug where a double breadcrumb would be shown on home pages.
* Fixes a bug where the indexation would continue indefinitely under specific circumstances.

Other:

* Removes all usages of `PDO` and `mysqli` directly and uses `wpdb` everywhere. This should prevent a lot of errors for database installations that have different encodings or configurations than what is generally seen.

= 14.0.1 =
Release Date: April 28th, 2020

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when a breadcrumb title was too long.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when `DB_CHARSET` was not defined.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when breadcrumbs were rendered in the admin.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal error would be thrown when the Yoast migrations table did not have a primary key.
* Fixes a bug where a fatal exception would be thrown when building an indexable failed.
* Fixes a bug where the order of the breadcrumbs was incorrect when more than 3 nested taxonomies were used.
* Fixes a bug where HTML tags would no longer be allowed in the breadcrumbs.
* Fixes a bug where no title would be shown in the Yoast indexation status modal.
* Fixes a bug where changes made through the `wpseo_robots` filter would not be shown in the googlebot and bingbot meta tag output.

Other:

* Yoast SEO needs to have the right to create a database index. If you have restricted the creation of database indexes on your setup, please make sure to temporarily allow Yoast SEO to create indexes before updating.

= 14.0 =

* No longer outputs an `article:section` and `article:tag` meta tag as none of the Open Graph consumers seems to use it.
* No longer outputs an `og:updated_time` meta tag as it was the same as `article:modified_time` and all Open Graph consumers seem to prefer that.
* No longer outputs an `og:image:secure_url` meta tag as it was the same as `og:image` and all Open Graph consumers seem to prefer that.
* Strips all HTML tags from text fields in the schema output.
* Adds `Term hierarchy` as a taxonomy snippet variable.
* Uses the Gravatar image as a fallback for author archive's `og:image` and `twitter:image`.

* Bing has added support for the same opt-in `meta robots` values as Google has, see their [announcement post](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/april-2020/Announcing-new-options-for-webmasters-to-control-their-snippets-at-Bing). We have decided to opt-in users of Yoast SEO by default to Bingbot crawling.
