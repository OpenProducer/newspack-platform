== Description ==

WooCommerce Admin is a new JavaScript-driven interface for managing your store. The plugin includes new and improved reports and a dashboard to monitor key metrics of your site.

**New Reports for WooCommerce**

WooCommerce Admin has a host of new reports that are optimized for speed and have advanced filters that allow you to dive into data about your store:

- Revenue Report
- Orders Report
- Products Report
- Categories Report
- Coupons Report
- Taxes Report
- Downloads Report
- Stock Report
- Customers Report

**Customizable Dashboard**

WooCommerce Admin also allows store owners to customize a new dashboard screen with ‚Äúperformance indicators‚Äù that correspond in importance to their store‚Äôs operation.

== Getting Started ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 5.3
* WooCommerce 3.6.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.6.20 or greater. PHP 7.2 or greater is recommended
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater. MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option, as WordPress handles the file transfers and you don't need to leave your web browser. To perform an automatic install:
1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to: Plugins > Add New.
3. Enter ‚ÄúWooCommerce Admin‚Äù in the Search field, and view details about its point release, the rating and description.
4. Select ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù when you‚Äôre ready.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress Codex contains instructions at [Manual Plugin Installation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Where can I report bugs or contribute to the project? =

Bugs should be reported in the [WooCommerce Admin GitHub repository](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/).

= This is awesome! Can I contribute? =

Yes, you can! Join our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/)

Release and roadmap notes are available on the [WooCommerce Developers Blog](https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/category/wc-admin/)
