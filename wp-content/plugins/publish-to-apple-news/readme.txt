== Changelog ==

= 2.1.0 =
* Enhancement: The cover component now supports captions. If a featured image is used for the cover, the caption will come from the attachment itself in the database. If the first image from the content is used, the caption will be read from the HTML. There is also a new filter, apple_news_exporter_cover_caption, which allows for filtering of the caption text.
* Enhancement: HTML is now allowed in lightbox image captions.
* Enhancement: Allows configuration of cover images in the sidebar / metabox explicitly, rather than pulling them out of the featured image or main content.
* Enhancement: Adds support for Brightcove videos via the Brightcove Video Connect plugin for videos added via either the Gutenberg block or the shortcode. Note that this feature will only work if you contact Apple support to link your Brightcove account with your Apple News channel.
* Enhancement: Replaces usage of the deprecated `advertisingSettings` object with the new `autoplacement.advertising` object. Bumps default advertisement frequency from 1 to 5 (out of 10).
* Enhancement: Adds an error to the notice bar if the `DATE_NOT_RECENT` API error is encountered advising the user to synchronize the time on their server to restore API connectivity.
* Enhancement: Adds padding above and below `EmbedWebVideo` components.
* Enhancement: Converts notices in a block editor context to native block editor notice components, rather than the previous custom implementation.
* Enhancement: In the block editor, warns when the post has unsaved changes, and publishing to Apple News would result in unsaved changes not being published.
* Bugfix: Removes Cover Art configuration, as Cover Art is no longer used by Apple.
* Bugfix: Fixes the logic in the default theme checker to properly check the configured values against the defaults and prompt the user if they are using the default theme that ships with Apple News without modification.
* Bugfix: Fixes a bug where renaming a theme would not carry over any changes made to the theme, and renaming the active theme would make it no longer active.
* Bugfix: If the same image is used for the featured image and the first image embedded into the post, it no longer shows up twice.
* Bugfix: Removed extra space between an image and its caption.
* Bugfix: If a custom excerpt is used, but the custom excerpt repeats text in its entirety from elsewhere in the article (e.g., the first paragraph), then the Intro component will be skipped. This prevents an issue where Apple will flag articles that contain repeated text due to the Intro component using a custom excerpt suitable in a WordPress context but not an Apple News context.
* Bugfix: Select menus are no longer oversized on the settings page.
* Updated filter name for `get_sections_for_post` to `apple_news_get_sections_for_post`.

= 2.0.8 =
* Enhancement: Adds styles for Button elements that are links which are added by the Gutenberg editor.
* Enhancement: Bumps the Apple News Format version from 1.7 to 1.11 to make support for new features possible, like LinkButton.

= 2.0.7 =
* Fixes a bug where sections by category is not checked by default for new posts.
* Fixes visual bug when manual section selection are visible.

= 2.0.6 =
* Bugfix: Rolled back support for Button elements for now due to a problematic implementation.

= 2.0.5 =
* Enhancement: Added support for audio, video, and table captions in Gutenberg.
* Enhancement: Adds styles for Button elements that are links.
* Bugfix: Blockquotes using alignments other than left are now properly recognized.
* Bugfix: Facebook URLs inline within other elements no longer getting converted to Facebook embeds.
* Diversity and Inclusion: Replaced instances of "whitelist" with "allowlist" throughout the codebase, change head branch from "master" to "develop". Language matters.

= 2.0.4 =
* Bump "tested up to" tag to 5.4.
* Upgrades node version used for compiling assets to version 12, and patches vulnerabilities reported via npm audit.
* Adds TikTok compatibility to the generic embed handler (props to @hrkhal for the fix).
* Fixes an undefined property notice when there is an error but no error message (props to @khoipro for the fix).
* Adds size attributes to select fields and API configuration fields for better readability (props to @paulschreiber for the fix).
* Fixes a bug where captions were not being correctly read from images.
* Adds a warning for the isPaid flag to prevent confusion if a channel is not set up for paid content.
* Fixes a bug where settings are not initialized to an array when the plugin is loaded via code.

= 2.0.3 =
* Bugfix: Resolves fatal error when trying to load posts that aren't active in some cases.

= 2.0.2 =
* Bugfix: Adds check for some 5.0.0+ functions before attempting to execute.
* Bugfix: Adds fallback and additional checks for sidebarPlugin retrieval of post meta.
* Bugfix: Only makes REST request for post save when Gutenberg is enabled.
* Enhancement: Enqueues block editor scripts with `enqueue_block_editor_assets`.

= 2.0.1 =
* Bugfix: Including the built pluginSidebar.js files with the WordPress.org distribution which were erroneously left off.

= 2.0.0 =
* Enhancement: Adds full support for Gutenberg. If Gutenberg is active for a post, uses a Gutenberg PluginSidebar to house all of the Apple News options rather than a metabox. Also adds support for new HTML generated by Gutenberg, including various embeds.
* Enhancement: Adds support for the isPaid flag to indicate that a post is part of News+ and requires a subscription to view.
* Enhancement: Set the default for Use Remote Images to Yes, as this should be the setting that all publishers use now that Apple News supports remote image URLs.
* Bugfix: Refreshes the nonce after re-authenticating to prevent data loss when Gutenberg is not active. Props to @hrkhal for the fix.

= 1.4.4 =
* Enhancement: Added the apple_news_notification_headers filter to allow headers to be added to the notification email message. Props to @paulschreiber for the addition.
* Bugfix: Improved handling of UTF-8 multibyte characters to provide better support for the French language.
* Updated the description that appears below the section selection checkboxes to more accurately explain the current behavior.
* Updated to the latest version of the phpcs and vipwpcs standards, resolving most issues, while allowlisting some rules for resolution in the next version. Props to @paulschreiber for doing most of the work here.

= 1.4.3 =
* Bugfix: Decodes HTML entities in URLs before performing remote file exists check for embedded media. Props to @kasparsd for the fix.

= 1.4.2 =
* Bugfix: Issues with making updates via the quick edit interface and on unsupported post types are now fixed, as the publish action bails out early if the nonce is not set, which occurs when the metabox does not load. Props to @danielbachhuber and @srtfisher for the fixes.
* Added 'apple_news_should_post_autopublish' filter to override automatic publish settings on a per-article basis. Props to @srtfisher for the update.

= 1.4.1 =
* Bugfix: Post types that were not registered with Publish to Apple News were failing the nonce check on publish/update because the metabox was not present. Refined the save_post hook to register only for post types with Publish to Apple News support to avoid this situation.

= 1.4.0 =
* Set HTML to the default output format (instead of Markdown) for new installs. HTML format is now recommended for all installs. Support for Markdown may be removed in a future version. Individual components now have a filter to toggle HTML support on or off for each component.
* Added support for HTML format to Heading and Quote components.
* Added support for tables (requires HTML support to be turned on) with new table styles defined in example themes, and intelligent defaults applied to existing themes based on comparable settings.
* Made Cover Art feature opt-in for new installs to avoid creating a plethora of additional image crops which may not be necessary. Sets the setting to enabled for existing installations during upgrade, since there is not a good way to know whether a user has utilized this feature without running a very expensive postmeta query.
* Added a "Refresh Sections" button on the Sections page to clear the cached settings list.
* Set the default publish and delete capabilities to the corresponding post publish and delete capabilities for the post type being edited, rather than requiring "manage_options," which is typically an administrator-only capability. This allows users with the ability to publish posts to also publish those posts to Apple News.
* Removed overzealous check for invalid Unicode sequences. Over the past several releases, enhancements have been made to better identify and fix problems with content that would cause issues upon pushing to Apple News. Therefore, the check for invalid Unicode character sequences is now not providing much value, and is inhibiting valid content (including emoji) from being pushed to Apple News.
* Added a function (apple_news_is_exporting) for determining whether an export is happening, which can be used in themes and plugins to change behavior if a hook is being executed in the context of an Apple News request.
* Added context to the message that is displayed when a post push is skipped explaining why it was skipped.
* Added a framework for saving dismissed state of persistent admin notices (such as those that appear after an upgrade) so that the close button causes the notice to not appear again for that user.
* Set the language code from blog settings for document properties (thanks @ffffelix).
* Added support for the isHidden property (thanks @jonesmatthew).
* Added support for Jetpack Tiled Galleries.
* Swapped deprecated wpcom_vip_* functions for core versions.
* Added expand/collapse functionality to the theme editor to reduce scrolling between where settings are set and the preview area.
* Brought entire codebase up to WordPress coding standards, which is now being verified through PHP CodeSniffer on each pull request.
* Updated Travis configuration for more robust testing.
* Bumped minimum required version to PHP 5.6 due to incompatibility with certain tools (e.g., Composer) required for running builds and tests.
* Security: Added nonce verification to all remaining form data processing sections.
* Bugfix: Added a handler for WordPress.com/OpenGraph Facebook embeds so that they properly render as Facebook components instead of a blockquote.
* Bugfix: Addressed an issue with sanitization that did not properly strip out script tags that contain CDATA with a greater than symbol.
* Bugfix: Empty meta_component_order settings can now be saved properly on the theme edit screen.
* Bugfix: No longer assumes that any embed that isn't YouTube is actually Vimeo. Performs a strict check for Vimeo embed signatures and drops the embed if it does not match known providers.
* Bugfix: Re-added erroneously removed apple_news_fonts_list hook.
* Bugfix: Fixed an error where the list of sections was occasionally being encoded as an object instead of an array.
* Bugfix: Fixed the undefined message warning if an article was deleted from iCloud, thereby breaking the linkage between the plugin and the Apple News API, to explain why the link was broken.
* Bugfix: Fixed undefined index and undefined variable notices in a few places.
* Bugfix: Fixed an assignment bug in class-admin-apple-post-sync.php (thanks @lgladdy and @dhanendran).
* Bugfix: Prevented empty text nodes from being added in a variety of ways, which was causing errors on publish in some cases, and unwanted extra space in articles in others.
* Bugfix: Prevented Apple News API timeouts from causing the entire WordPress install to hang by only using long remote request timeouts when making a POST request to the Apple News API.
* Bugfix: Fixed improper handling of several different types of links, such as empty URLs, malformed URLs, root-relative URLs, and anchor links.
* Bugfix: Properly decoded ampersands and other HTML-encoded entities when using Markdown format.
* Bugfix: Removed style tags and their contents where they appear inline.

= 1.3.0 =
* Moved JSON customizations to themes so that JSON can be customized on a per-theme basis.
* Enabled access to postmeta in custom JSON so that values from postmeta fields can be inserted into customized JSON.
* Removed all formatting settings from the settings option in favor of storing them in themes. This is a potentially breaking change if you are using custom code that relies on formatting settings stored in the settings option.
* Removed the option for JSON customization in favor of moving those settings to themes. This is a potentially breaking change if you are accessing the custom JSON option directly.
* Deprecated access of formatting settings using the Settings object.
* Added a new Theme object to handle all formatting settings.
* Bugfix: Fixed a bug where themes were not being automatically switched via section mappings.
* Bugfix: HTML in titles is now supported.

* Bugfix: Images, audio, and video with blank or invalid URLs are no longer included, avoiding an error with the API
* Bugfix: Image blocks with multiple src attributes (e.g., when using a lazyload plugin with a raw &lt;img&gt; tag in the &lt;noscript&gt; block) are now intelligently probed

= 1.2.5 =
* Bugfix: Fixed version of PHPUnit at 5.7.* for PHP 7.* and 4.8.* for PHP 5.* in the Travis configuration to fix a bug with incompatibility with PHPUnit 6
* Bugfix: Set the base URL for the Apple News API to https://news-api.apple.com everywhere for better adherence to official guidance in the API docs (props to ffffelix for providing the initial PR)
* Bugfix: Made the administrator email on the settings screen no longer required if debug mode is set to "no"
* Bugfix: Converted the error that occurs when a list of sections cannot be retrieved from the API to a non-fatal to fix a problem where the content of the editor would appear white-on-white
* Bugfix: Resolved an error that occurs on some systems during plugin activation on the Add New screen due to a duplicated root plugin file in the WordPress.org version of the plugin
