/**
 * Card Expiry Warning Email.
 *
 * Sends a warning email when a reader's saved credit card is about to expire
 * on an active WooCommerce Subscription. Runs a daily cron scan to find
 * expiring CC tokens and notifies the subscription owner.
 *
 * Publisher-respect — first-deploy seed:
 *
 *   On the very first scheduled scan after install (detected via the
 *   absence of `newspack_card_expiry_warning_seeded` option), this class
 *   runs a SEED pass instead of a normal scan: it iterates the same
 *   in-window (subscription, token) pairs the normal scan would have
 *   sent to, marks each as already-warned via a per-token SEEDED meta
 *   entry (see SEEDED_META_PREFIX), and writes the seeded option flag
 *   — all WITHOUT sending. On subsequent scheduled runs, the normal
 *   scan proceeds.
 *
 *   This protects publishers from a Day 0 mass-email burst. Sites
 *   that DO want to send the deferred warnings (publisher-initiated
 *   explicit action) can run:
 *
 *     wp newspack card-expiry-warning-backfill
 *
 *   The CLI command passes a $bypass_idempotency flag to
 *   maybe_send_warning() so the per-token SEEDED meta doesn't block
 *   the send. The SENT meta (SENT_META_PREFIX) still blocks even
 *   under bypass, so CLI re-runs on the same window are silently
 *   idempotent — see is_already_processed() for the gating logic.
 *   See Newspack\CLI\WooCommerce_Subscriptions for the command.
 *
 * Publisher-respect — per-pass send cap:
 *
 *   `scan_expiring_cards` caps ACTUAL SENDS per cron tick (filterable
 *   via `newspack_card_expiry_warning_limit_per_pass`, default 100) so
 *   a migration day or unusual burst doesn't dump thousands of emails
 *   into the publisher's mail provider in one go. The cap applies to
 *   real sends only — already-processed pairs (SEEDED or SENT) skip
 *   via the idempotency gate without counting toward it. A site
 *   exceeding the cap on a given day sees remaining warnings roll
 *   into subsequent cron runs.
 *
 *   Discovery memory is bounded by the window size (date-range ×
 *   subscription-density), not by a SQL LIMIT — the legacy SQL LIMIT
 *   caused starvation (deterministic ORDER BY token_id ASC made the
 *   same first-N tokens surface daily; once marked, the unprocessed
 *   remainder never got reached). See `scan_expiring_cards` for the
 *   send-cap implementation.
