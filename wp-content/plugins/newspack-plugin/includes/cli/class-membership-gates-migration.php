 * WP-CLI commands to migrate WooCommerce Memberships content restriction to

 * overrides those plans never carried.
 *
 * Ported from the standalone `migrate-memberships` drop-in so the tooling ships
 * with the plugin. The class file is included on every request (like the other
 * CLI classes), but only the command registration is gated on WP_CLI, so the
 * runtime cost outside CLI is a class definition. `migrate-membership-gates` writes
 * through the Content_Gate / Content_Rules data layer; `migrate-post-exemptions` is
 * postmeta plumbing and touches neither.

/**
 * WooCommerce Memberships → Access Control content restriction migration CLI commands.
 */
class Membership_Gates_Migration {

	/**
	 * Create or update Newspack Access Control content gates from WooCommerce
	 * Membership plans.
	 *
	 * Plans with identical content restriction rules are grouped and represented by
	 * a single gate whose title is all matching plan names joined with " | ". Plans
	 * with different restrictions each get their own gate.
	 *
	 * For each gate (group of plans):
	 * - Creates a new content gate (or updates an existing one matched by title).
	 * - Sets content rules from the shared restriction rules.
	 * - Enables registration settings (always) and custom_access settings (only
	 *   when every plan in the group requires a purchase — a group that also holds a
	 *   signup plan is registration-gated, since either plan grants access in WCM).
	 * - Copies block content from the first plan's np_memberships_gate post (falling
	 *   back to the Primary gate) into the gate's registration / paid-access layouts.
	 *
	 * Dry-run by default; pass --live to write.
	 *
	 * Both modes surface predictable migration issues as WARN rows. Purchase-mode
	 * gaps (no custom_access layout found, no product IDs after stripping variations)
	 * and content-rule slugs the evaluator cannot resolve are computable from the
	 * group data before any write, so they appear in dry-run and make the planning
	 * pass predictive rather than optimistic. On --live each written gate is
	 * additionally re-read and checked against the full set of conditions the frontend
	 * evaluator applies; any gate that would not restrict — or would restrict less
	 * than the plan it came from, e.g. a paid plan that migrated to a gate any
	 * registered reader passes — is reported as a WARN row rather than counted as a
	 * plain success. Migrated gates stay dormant until WooCommerce Memberships is
	 * deactivated, so without this an unenforceable gate would look migrated for as
	 * long as it takes someone to notice at cutover.
	 *
	 * Re-running is NOT edit-preserving: an existing gate matched by title has its
	 * content rules and layout content overwritten with freshly extracted markup, so
	 * any customization made in the admin after a previous run is lost. A layout is
	 * left alone when nothing could be extracted for it, so an empty extraction never
	 * blanks a working layout.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--live]
	 * : Apply the changes. Without this flag the command runs as a dry-run and writes nothing.
	 *
	 * [--plan=<id>]
	 * : Only process the plan with this post ID. Useful for testing.
	 *
	 * ## EXAMPLES
	 *
	 *     wp newspack migrate-membership-gates
	 *     wp newspack migrate-membership-gates --live
	 *     wp newspack migrate-membership-gates --plan=711923
	 *
	 * @param array $args       Positional args (unused).
	 * @param array $assoc_args Named args.
