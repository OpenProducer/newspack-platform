	 * Keyed per pass rather than held as a single flag because 'the_content' nests:
	 * a callback registered after self::RESTRICTION_PRIORITY may run
	 * apply_filters( 'the_content', … ) itself, and core runs the whole callback
	 * list again for that inner pass. Sharing one slot, the inner pass would consume
	 * the outer pass's state, and the outer pass would then fall back to unfiltered
	 * markup, silently discarding the third-party filtering this substitution exists
	 * to preserve.
	 *
	 * Depth is also what keeps the bookkeeping self-cleaning. Neither filter is
	 * exception-safe — a callback throwing in between leaves the entry behind — but
	 * an entry can only ever be read by another pass at that exact depth, and
	 * {@see self::replace_restricted_content()} claims the slot on the way in, so a

	 * What depth cannot establish on its own is that the pass holding the entry is
	 * the one that substituted, so {@see self::handle_restricted_content()} pairs it
	 * with the substitution filter still being registered. That stands in for the
	 * substitution having run in every ordinary execution, since priorities run
	 * ascending and core does not revisit one it has passed. Defeating it takes four
	 * coincident manipulations of this class's own filters: the substitution filter
	 * removed before self::RESTRICTION_PRIORITY, then re-added by a callback above
	 * it, over a leftover entry at this same depth, on a restricted post. Short of
	 * all four the mismatch falls through to the stored teaser and gate, so the
