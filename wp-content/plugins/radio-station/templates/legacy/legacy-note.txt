Since version 2.3.0, Radio Station uses content filters for page content instead of templates.
This is because the existing templates were based on use with 20xx themes. So they were not fully
compatible with other themes, nor was this in keeping the plugin theme-agnostic (independent of theme.)
You can still use any of the legacy templates in this directory in your child theme and modify them to 
suit your needs, and they will be used instead of the new content filtering method if they are found.
Alternatively, you can unhook an existing content filter and replace it with your own custom function.
