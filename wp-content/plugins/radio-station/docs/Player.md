# Radio Station Stream Player

***


## Stream Player

The Stream Player is available as a Shortcode, Widget or Block. In Pro it is also available as a Sitewide Bar Player, as well as an Elementor Widget and Beaver Builder Module.

#### Default Player Settings

Default settings for the Player can be set on the Plugin Settings page on the Player tab. These will be used in widgets wherever the widget options are set to "Default". This saves you from setting them twice, but also means that you can override these defaults in individual widgets as needed. (see [Options](./Options.md#player) for a list of these options.)

* *Player Title*: Display your Radio Station Title in Player by default.
* *Player Image*: Display your Radio Station Image in Player by default.
* *Script*: Default audio script to use for Radio Streaming Player. Ampliture, Howler or Jplayer.
* *Fallback Scripts*: Fallback audio scripts to try if/when the default Player script fails.
* *Theme*: Default Player Controls theme style. Light or dark to match your theme.
* *Buttons*: Default Player Buttons shape style. Circular, rounded or square.
* *Volume Controls*: Which volume controls to display in the Player by default.
* *Player Debug Mode*: Output player debug information in browser javascript console.
* *Start Volume*: Initial volume for when the Player starts playback.
* *Single Player*: Stop other Player instances when a Player is started.

Please note you will not see volume controls when using an iOS device as they are not supported.

#### [Pro] Continous Player Integration

Developers should note that the continous player page transitions are implemented by adding click event listeners to `a` link tags. This means that dynamic links - those that do not exist on page load but are added in content later - will need special treatment to preserve continuous playback. Some examples of these include some mobile menus or breadcrumbs that are created by javascript dynamically on hover, and AJAX loaded "more" or filtered content. 

The solution to integrated these dynamic links is to use a filter to allow Teleporter (the page transition plugin) target the classes of the dynamic links. Knowing these claseses to target, Teleporter will then handle them via click event bubbling. Here's an example of how that can be done. (Note the format is just a comma separated list of classes without a `.` prefix:)

```
add_filter( 'teleporter_dynamic_link_classes', 'my_custom_dynamic_link_classes' );
function my_custom_dynamic_link_classes( $classes ) {
    $classes = 'mobile-menu,elementor-item';
    return $classes;
}
```

Similarly, if there are links that you wish to force to not transition for some reason, you can use the `teleporter_ignore_link_classes` filter in the same way. If you need to use selectors other than classes, you can use the filters `teleporter_dynamic_selectors` and `teleporter_ignore_selectors` to add those respectively also.

* *Volume Track and Knob Colors*: To style the volume slider track and it's thumb knob.
		
And in addition to the existing Light and Dark button themes, you can also choose from colored button themes of: Red, Orange, Yellow, Light Green, Green, Cyan, Light Blue, Blue, Purple or Magenta.
