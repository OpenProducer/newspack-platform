# Radio Station Plugin Roles

***

Note that while the default interface in WordPress allows you to assign a single role to a user, it also supports multiple roles, but you need to add a plugin to get an interface for this.  Radio Station Pro will include a Role Editing Interface for assigning plugin roles to users directly, and this will be available on the Plugin Settings page. 

For the free version, you can also use the [Multiple Roles Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multiple-roles/) to assign roles from a User page. If you want even more fine-grained control over specific user capabilities and roles, then you can use the [User Role Editor Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) or Justin Tadlock's excellent [Members](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members/) plugin.

### Plugin Roles

#### Show Host Role
Previously labelled DJ role, users with this Role can be assigned to a Show and are displayed as Show Hosts on the Show page, as well as in other widgets and shortcodes if the option to display them is set. Hosts assigned to a Show are then able to Edit that Show as well.

#### Show Producer Role
Similar to the Show Host role, users with this Role can be assigned to a Show and are displayed on the Show page, as well as in other widgets and shortcodes if the option to display them is set. Producers assigned to a Show are then able to Edit that Show as well.

#### Show Editor Role
Since 2.3.0, a new Show Editor role has been added with Publish and Edit capabilities for all Radio Station Post Types. You can assign this Role to any user to give them full Station Schedule updating permissions, without them needing to be a site Administrator.
