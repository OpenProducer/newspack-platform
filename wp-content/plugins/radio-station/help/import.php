<h1>Import Show Data via YAML file</h1>

<p>
To import and optionally replace all your show data with whatever is contained in a data file. Click the
<strong>Select file</strong> button below and select the file you wish to import. Check the box to delete
existing data if desired, then click the import button.
</p>

<p>
<mark class="warning w-red">
WARNING! </mark>If <strong>"Delete existing show data"</strong> is checked, importing will erase everything you currently have in your show database and
replace it with whatever is in the file you import. There is no undo. Take a backup first.
